# Executive Summary: Model Recommendations for NQ Futures Trading

This document provides a high-level summary of the model recommendations and implementation details for improving the NQ futures trading system.

## Key Findings from Current Implementation

- The current system uses two CatBoost regressors with different loss functions (Quantile and MAE)
- These models are combined using a stacking approach with ElasticNetCV as the meta-learner
- The feature engineering process is comprehensive, using multi-timeframe data (5min, 15min, 1h)
- The system shows promising results but could benefit from more diverse model types and advanced stacking techniques

## Recommended Enhancements

### 1. Diversify Base Models

- **Add LightGBM and XGBoost models** to complement CatBoost
- **Implement deep learning models** (LSTM, CNN) to capture sequential patterns
- **Include linear models** (Bayesian Ridge, Quantile Regression) for robustness

### 2. Advanced Stacking Architecture

- **Two-tier stacking** approach:
  - Tier 1: Group similar models (e.g., all tree-based models)
  - Tier 2: Combine different model types with a sophisticated meta-learner

### 3. Market Regime Awareness

- **Implement regime classification** based on volatility and trend strength
- **Train specialized models** for each market regime
- **Dynamically adjust model weights** based on current market conditions

### 4. NQ-Specific Features

- **Overnight gap analysis** to capture the significant price jumps common in NQ
- **Tech sector correlation** features to leverage NQ's tech-heavy composition
- **Volume profile analysis** to identify key support/resistance levels

## Expected Benefits

1. **Improved accuracy** through diverse model perspectives
2. **Better adaptability** to changing market conditions
3. **Reduced drawdowns** during volatile periods
4. **More consistent performance** across different market regimes

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Add LightGBM and XGBoost models (quick win)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement two-tier stacking architecture
3. **Phase 3**: Add market regime classification
4. **Phase 4**: Develop NQ-specific features
5. **Phase 5**: Integrate deep learning models

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Measure of risk-adjusted return
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses
- **Win Rate by Regime**: Performance across different market conditions

## Conclusion

The proposed enhancements build upon the solid foundation of the existing system while addressing its limitations. By implementing these recommendations, the trading system should achieve more robust performance across different market conditions while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.
