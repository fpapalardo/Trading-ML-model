# Model Recommendations for NQ Futures Trading

## Current Model Analysis

After analyzing the codebase, I found that the current implementation primarily uses:

1. **CatBoost Regressors** with different loss functions:
   - Model 1: Quantile loss (alpha=0.6) to handle asymmetric errors
   - Model 2: MAE loss for robustness against outliers

2. **Stacking Approach**:
   - Base models: Two CatBoost regressors
   - Meta-learner: ElasticNetCV with various l1_ratio values

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Multi-timeframe approach (5min, 15min, 1h)
   - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
   - Price action features (candle patterns, body/range ratios)
   - Time and session features

## Proposed Model Enhancements

### 1. Additional Base Models

#### Gradient Boosting Variants
- **LightGBM**: Known for faster training and better handling of categorical features
  - Implementation: Use with different loss functions (quantile, huber)
  - Benefit: Potentially faster training and different error distributions

- **XGBoost**: Robust implementation with regularization options
  - Implementation: Use with different tree depths and learning rates
  - Benefit: Strong regularization capabilities to prevent overfitting

#### Linear Models
- **Bayesian Ridge Regression**: Probabilistic approach with uncertainty estimates
  - Implementation: Use as a base model alongside tree-based models
  - Benefit: Provides uncertainty estimates and handles different error distributions

- **Quantile Regression**: Direct prediction of different quantiles
  - Implementation: Train multiple models for different quantiles (0.25, 0.5, 0.75)
  - Benefit: Better risk assessment by modeling the full distribution

#### Deep Learning Models
- **LSTM Networks**: Capture sequential patterns in time series
  - Implementation: Use the existing LSTM wrapper with different architectures
  - Benefit: Better capture of temporal dependencies in price movements

- **1D CNN**: Extract local patterns from price and indicator sequences
  - Implementation: Use the existing CNN wrapper with different filter sizes
  - Benefit: Effective at capturing local patterns and reducing noise

### 2. Advanced Stacking Combinations

#### Heterogeneous Model Stacking
- **Tier 1**: Combine models of the same type with different hyperparameters
  - Implementation: Stack multiple CatBoost models with different depths/learning rates
  - Benefit: Reduces variance while maintaining the strengths of the algorithm

- **Tier 2**: Combine different model types
  - Implementation: Stack tree-based models (CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost) with linear models
  - Benefit: Captures both linear and non-linear relationships

#### Time-Aware Stacking
- **Temporal Ensemble**: Different weights for models based on market regime
  - Implementation: Train a meta-model that considers time features
  - Benefit: Adapts to changing market conditions

#### Feature-Specific Models
- **Indicator-Specific Models**: Train models on specific feature groups
  - Implementation: Separate models for price action, volume, momentum, etc.
  - Benefit: Each model can specialize in a particular aspect of market behavior

### 3. Multi-Task Learning Approaches

- **Joint Classification-Regression**: Train models to predict both direction and magnitude
  - Implementation: Custom loss function that combines classification and regression objectives
  - Benefit: More coherent predictions between direction and magnitude

- **Quantile Regression Forest**: Predict full distribution of returns
  - Implementation: Use quantile regression forest to model different percentiles
  - Benefit: Better risk assessment and position sizing

### 4. Market Regime-Aware Models

- **Volatility Regime Classification**: Pre-classify market regimes
  - Implementation: Train a classifier to identify high/low volatility regimes
  - Benefit: Use regime-specific models for different market conditions

- **Trend Strength Models**: Adjust predictions based on trend strength
  - Implementation: Incorporate trend strength as a feature or model weight
  - Benefit: Better performance in trending vs. choppy markets

## Specific Recommendations for NQ Futures

### 1. Model Combination for NQ Futures

Based on the characteristics of NQ futures (high volatility, strong trends, sensitive to news):

```python
# Recommended base models
base_models = [
    ('catboost_quantile', CatBoostRegressor(loss_function='Quantile:alpha=0.6', iterations=1000)),
    ('catboost_mae', CatBoostRegressor(loss_function='MAE', iterations=1000)),
    ('lightgbm_huber', LGBMRegressor(objective='huber', n_estimators=1000)),
    ('xgboost_reg', XGBRegressor(objective='reg:squarederror', n_estimators=1000)),
    ('lstm_reg', LSTMWrapper(input_shape=X_train.shape[1], units=64, dropout=0.2))
]

# Meta-learner with time-aware features
meta_model = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('meta_reg', CatBoostRegressor(loss_function='RMSE', iterations=500))
])

# Final stacked model
stacked_model = StackingRegressor(
    estimators=base_models,
    final_estimator=meta_model,
    cv=TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5),
    passthrough=True  # Include original features
)
```

### 2. Feature Importance for NQ

NQ futures are particularly sensitive to:

1. **Overnight gaps**: Add features that capture overnight price changes
2. **Tech sector indicators**: Add correlation with QQQ and major tech stocks
3. **Economic releases**: Incorporate economic calendar data as features
4. **Market microstructure**: Add order flow and volume profile features

### 3. Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing

Implement dynamic position sizing based on:

1. Model confidence (prediction magnitude)
2. Current market volatility (ATR)
3. Time of day (reduce size during less liquid periods)

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Implement additional base models (LightGBM, XGBoost)
2. **Phase 2**: Develop advanced stacking approach with heterogeneous models
3. **Phase 3**: Add market regime classification
4. **Phase 4**: Implement NQ-specific features
5. **Phase 5**: Optimize position sizing based on model confidence and market conditions

## Evaluation Framework

To properly evaluate these model combinations:

1. **Walk-forward testing**: Use expanding window approach
2. **Multiple metrics**: Beyond accuracy, focus on Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and profit factor
3. **Regime-specific evaluation**: Evaluate performance in different market regimes
4. **Transaction cost analysis**: Include realistic slippage and commission models

By implementing these recommendations, the trading system should achieve more robust performance across different market conditions while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.
